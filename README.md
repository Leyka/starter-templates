:gift: Minimal templates that help me quick start new projects

## Node.js Templates

- [Express with Babel](https://github.com/Leyka/starter-templates/tree/main/express-babel)
- [Express with TypeScript](https://github.com/Leyka/starter-templates/tree/main/express-typescript)

### What's next ?

Once, you downloaded the template, packages listed are (most probably) outdated so make sure to update node packages.

I'm using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as my npm package manager but you can you use the classic npm CLI. Make sure to delete `yarn.lock` file as you won't need it.

With Yarn, `cd` into the template folder where `package.json` is then run :

```
yarn upgrade
```
